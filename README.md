*   **API Key:**  You *must* have a valid Google Gemini API key to use this application.  Obtain one from the Google Cloud Console.
*   **Rate Limits:**  Be aware of the Gemini API's rate limits.  The code includes a 10-second delay between paragraph translations to help avoid exceeding these limits.  You may need to adjust this delay depending on your usage and the API's current limits.
*   **Error Handling:** The application includes error handling for common issues, but it's not exhaustive.  For production use, consider adding more comprehensive error handling and logging.
*   **Demo Project:** This is a demonstration project and may have limitations.  For critical translations, always consult a professional human translator.
